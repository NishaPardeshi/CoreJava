Important things to remember

1) Always use same attributes of an object to generate hashCode() and equals() both. As in our case, we have used employee id.

2) equals() must be consistent (if the objects are not modified, then it must keep returning the same value).

3) Whenever a.equals(b), then a.hashCode() must be same as b.hashCode().

4) If you override one, then you should override the other.

Special Attention When Using in ORM

If you’re dealing with an ORM, make sure to always use getters, 
and never field references in hashCode() and equals(). 
This is for reason, in ORM, occasionally fields are lazy loaded and not available until called their getter methods.

For example, 
In our Employee class if we use e1.id == e2.id. 
It is very much possible that id field is lazy loaded. 
So in this case, one might be zero or null, and thus resulting in incorrect behavior.

But if uses e1.getId() == e2.getId(), 
we can be sure even if field is lazy loaded; 
calling getter will populate the field first.
