 *Creating the Chain
 *This is a very important step and we should create the chain carefully, 
 *otherwise a processor might not be getting any request at all. 
 *For example, in our implementation if we keep the first processor chain as Dollar10Dispenser 
 *and then Dollar20Dispenser, 
 *then the request will never be forwarded to the second processor and the chain will become useless.
