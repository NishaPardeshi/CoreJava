 *Concrete Chain Implementations
 *We need to create different processor classes that will implement the DispenseChain interface 
 *and provide implementation of dispense methods. 
 *Since we are developing our system to work with three types of currency bills – 50$, 20$ and 10$, 
 *we will create three concrete implementations.
