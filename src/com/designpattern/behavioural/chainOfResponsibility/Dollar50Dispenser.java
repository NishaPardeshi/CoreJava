 *Concrete Chain Implementations
 *We need to create different processor classes that will implement the DispenseChain interface 
 *and provide implementation of dispense methods. 
 *Since we are developing our system to work with three types of currency bills – 50$, 20$ and 10$, 
 *we will create three concrete implementations.
 *The important point to note here is the implementation of dispense method, 
 *you will notice that every implementation is trying to process the request and based on the amount, 
 *it might process some or full part of it. 
 *If it’s not able to process it fully, it sends the request to the next processor in chain 
 *to process the remaining request. 
 *If the processor is not able to process anything, 
 *it just forwards the same request to the next chain.
