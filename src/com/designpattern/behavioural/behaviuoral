Behavioral Design Patterns

1)	Chain of Responsibility Pattern
	A method called in one class can move up a hierarchy to find an 
	object that can properly execute the method.
	
2)	Command Pattern
	An object encapsulates everything needed to execute a method in another object.

3)	Interpreter Pattern
	Define a macro language and syntax, parsing input into objects which perform the correct opertaions.

4)	Iterator Pattern
	One object can traverse the elements of another object.

5)	Mediator Pattern
	An object distributes communication between two or more objects.

6)	Memento Pattern
	One object stores another objects state.

7)	Observer Pattern
	An object notifies other object(s) if it changes.

8)	State Pattern
	An object appears to change its` class when the class it passes calls 
	through to switches itself for a related class.

9)	Strategy Pattern
	An object controls which of a family of methods is called. 
	Each method is in its` own class that extends a common base class.

10)	Template Method Pattern
	An abstract class defines various methods, and has one non-overridden method 
	which calls the various methods.

11)	Visitor Pattern
	One or more related classes have the same method, which calls a method specific 
	for themselves in another class.
