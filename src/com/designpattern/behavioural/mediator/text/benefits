Important Points

1)	Mediator pattern is useful when the communication logic between objects is complex, 
	we can have a central point of communication that takes care of communication logic. 
2)	Java Message Service (JMS) uses Mediator pattern along with Observer pattern 
	to allow applications to subscribe and publish data to other applications.	
3)	We should not use mediator pattern just to achieve lose-coupling because if the 
	number of mediators will grow, then it will become hard to maintain them.
