 The best example of this pattern is java compiler that interprets the 
 java source code into byte code that is understandable by JVM. 
 Google Translator is also an example of interpreter pattern 
 where the input can be in any language and we can get the output interpreted in another language.
 
 java.util.Pattern and subclasses of java.text.Format 
 are some of the examples of interpreter pattern used in JDK.
