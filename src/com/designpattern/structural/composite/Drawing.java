 * Composite
 * A composite object contains group of leaf objects and we should provide some helper methods to add 
 * or delete leafs from the group. 
 * We can also provide a method to remove all the elements from the group.
 * Notice that composite also implements component and behaves similar to leaf 
 * except that it can contain group of leaf elements.
