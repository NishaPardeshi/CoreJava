Structural Design Patterns

1)	Adapter Pattern
	A class extends another class, takes in an object, 
	and makes the taken object behave like the extended class.
	
2)	Bridge Pattern
	An abstraction and implementation are in different class hierarchies.

3)	Composite Pattern
	Assemble groups of objects with the same signature.

4)	Decorator Pattern
	One class takes in another class, both of which extend the same abstract class, and adds functionality.

5)	Facade Pattern
	One class has a method that performs a complex process calling several other classes.

6)	Flyweight Pattern
	The reusable and variable parts of a class are broken into two classes to save resources.

7)	Proxy Pattern
	One class controls the creation of and access to objects in another class.
