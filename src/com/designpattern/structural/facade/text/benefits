1)	Facade pattern is more like a helper for client applications, 
	it doesn’t hide subsystem interfaces from the client. 
		Whether to use Facade or not is completely dependent on client code.
2)	Facade pattern can be applied at any point of development, usually when the number of interfaces grow 
	and system gets complex.
3)	Subsystem interfaces are not aware of Facade and they shouldn’t have any reference of the Facade interface.
4)	Facade pattern should be applied for similar kind of interfaces, 
	its purpose is to provide a single interface rather than multiple interfaces that does the similar kind of jobs.
5)	We can use Factory pattern with Facade to provide better interface to client systems.
