/**
 * If you can use reflection, for example in Java or .NET languages, you can register new product classes 
 * to the factory without even changing the factory itself. 
 * For creating objects inside the factory class without knowing the object type we keep a map 
 * between the productID and the class type of the product. In this case when a new product is added 
 * to the application it has to be registered to the factory. 
 * This operation doesn't require any change in the factory class code.
