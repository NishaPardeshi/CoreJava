 *Before java 7, while using generics you had to supply type parameters to variables types and to their actual types. 
 *Now, it has been relieved a bit in this new java 7 feature, 
 *and a blank diamond on right side of declaration will work fine.
 *Compiler is smart enough in java 7 to identify that blank diamond infer to type defined on left hand side of declaration.
