/**
 * isEqual method signature showing syntax to use generics type in methods. 
 * Also notice how to use these methods in our java program. We can specify type while calling these 
 * methods or we can invoke them like a normal method. 
 * Java compiler is smart enough to determine the type of variable to be used, 
 * this facility is called as type inference.
