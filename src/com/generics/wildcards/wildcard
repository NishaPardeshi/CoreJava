 covariance (narrowing a reference) 
 and contra-variance (widening a reference).

In generic code, the question mark (?), called the wildcard, represents an unknown type. 
A wildcard parameterized type is an instantiation of a generic type where at least one type argument is a wildcard.

 Examples of wildcard parameterized types are 
 Collection<?>, 
 List<? extends Number>, 
 Comparator<? super String> 
 Pair<String,?>
 
 The wildcard can be used in a variety of situations: as the type of a parameter, 
 field, or local variable; sometimes as a return type.
 
 The wildcard is never used as a type argument for a generic method invocation, 
 a generic class instance creation, or a supertype.
 
Collection<?> 
denotes all instantiations of the Collection interface regardless of the type argument.

List<? extends Number> 
denotes all list types where the element type is a subtype of Number.

Comparator<? super String> 
denotes all instantiations of the Comparator interface for type argument types that are supertypes of String.
