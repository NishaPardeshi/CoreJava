 *Let’s assume we are defining a method where we will only be adding different fruits inside this basket.
 *addAll(Collection<? super T> c, T... elements)“. 
 *In such case, basket is used for storing the elements so it should be called consumer of elements.
 *We are able to add apple and even Asian apple inside basket,
 * but we are not able to add Fruit (super type of apple) to basket. Why?
 * Reason:  basket is a reference to a List of something that is a supertype of Apple. 
 * We cannot know which supertype it is, but we know that Apple and any of its subtypes 
 * (which are subtype of Fruit) can be added to be without problem 
 * (you can always add a subtype in collection of supertype). 
 * So, now we can add any type of Apple inside basket.
 * What about getting data out of such a type? 
 * It turns out that you the only thing you can get out of it will be Object instances: 
 * since we cannot know which supertype it is, the compiler can only guarantee 
 * that it will be a reference to an Object, since Object is the supertype of any Java type.
 * 
 * We are putting elements inside collection “List<? super Apple> basket“; 
 * so here this basket is actually consuming the elements i.e. apples. 
 * In simple words, when you want to ONLY add elements inside a collection, 
 * treat it as a consumer and use “? super T>” syntax. Now, “Consumer super” also should make more sense to you.
