Summary

Based on above reasoning and examples, let’s summarize our learning in bullet points.

Use the <? extends T> wildcard 
if you need to retrieve object of type T from a collection.

Use the <? super T> wildcard 
if you need to put objects of type T in a collection.

If you need to satisfy both things, well, don’t use any wildcard. As simple as it is.

In short, remember the term PECS. Producer extends Consumer super.
